# Hw4:
## In this Homework we practice ploting histogram and filtering data to compare histograms. We also, practice Hyphothesis teting by KS-test and t-test.
We test if the two samples are equal and also if the two samples are drawn from the same distribution.


I have done this by myself and didn't collaborate.
