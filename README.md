Foundation of Data Science course.
I learned data science in practice and by doing projects.
1) I attended this class to complete my understanding of data science concept. I think it will be a very helpful course for me as the professor is expert in this field. 
2) - I'd like to learn advanced tools in learning, clustering and inference. I know the basic concepts but don't have experience on this.
- Also, I like to know more anout data structure.
-  I like to gain some expereineces on working with big data since it is very challenging and timeconsuming to organize and structure big data. 
- I'll be very helpful to gain some skills and hands-on experiences on exploratory data analysis.
  Needles to say that I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest of the course materials as well.
  
4) I love coding and I'm good in mathematics and probability. I have a pretty good experience working in Jupyter and DataFrames. (There is still a lot to learn)
